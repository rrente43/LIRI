## LIRI Bot

### Overview

I've created a similar system to SIRI only that it is called "LIRI". Unlike SIRI, LIRI doesn't have most of its functions.(Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface).However, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. With LIRI you can command line node and it will retrive data.

LIRI offers restricted commands. You can type "movie" and the name of a movie to find information about a movie.
You can also access sportify by typing in "spotify" along with any artist/song/album.
